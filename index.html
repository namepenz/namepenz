   <h4>NAMEPENZ의 유례</h4>
   <p>Lee Newman patented a felt-tipped marking pen in 1910.[2] In 1926, Benjamin Paskach patented a "fountain paintbrush",[3] as he called it, which consisted of a sponge-tipped handle containing various paint colors. Markers of this sort began to be popularized with the sale of Sidney Rosenthal's Magic Marker (1953), which consisted of a glass tube of ink with a felt wick.
